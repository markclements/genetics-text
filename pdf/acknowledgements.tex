\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

The creation of this book was greatly facilitated and owes a major debt to \href{https://www.wikipedia.org}{Wikipedia} and its large number of voluntary contributors. I very liberally copied from many Wikipedia pages and then remixed, edited, adapted and added text. With your continued support and help this book can only get better over time. I urge you to email me with your criticisms and suggestions at \href{mailto:nsucher@rcc.mass.edu}{\nolinkurl{nsucher@rcc.mass.edu}}. This book is made available as an open educational resource under \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en}{Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported} United States License for others to do as I did and improve and adapt to specific requirements.
